# 1.Weather Data Visualization (Python)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with REST APIs
Process and analyze data using Python
Create professional data visualizations
Write clean, documented code

## What This Project Does
This program fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for multiple cities and creates visual comparisons including:

Temperature comparisons
Humidity levels
Atmospheric pressure
Wind speeds
Statistical correlations between weather parameters

## Technologies Used

Python 3.x
requests - For API calls
pandas - For data processing
matplotlib - For creating charts
seaborn - For enhanced visualizations
